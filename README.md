# Tip of the TypeScript workshop files

If you happen to be here, you most likely attended my TypeScript workshop in Berlin or lately via Zoom. 

This repo will be updated with more content in the near future, so ⭐️ for now and enjoy more updates later! 

## How to use the project?

- go to `/src/Workshop.tsx` to revise the basic concepts that we explored together
- go to `/src/App.tsx` to see the how beautifully TS works between different files 
- all of the concept revision you will be able to do without actuallt running the project
- in case you still want to run the project, running `yarn` from the root folder and `yarn start` will do the job

## How to find me if you have any questions? 

- recently I created a separate [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devArturs) account for all things `dev` so that is probably the best place to get a hold on me.
